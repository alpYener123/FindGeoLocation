ALI ORDERS, ALP DOES:

1) In readme.md, add straightforward instructions to use the package. Like you import the package and just call a func and show the print output. Check this repo https://github.com/carpedm20/emoji

2) Remove the paths in codes like on-drive paths, and avoid hard coding. To learn about clean coding and general coding, check Uncle Bob's Book. http://cleancoder.com/products

3) Add docstring for the methods and classes.
