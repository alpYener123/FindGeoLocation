ALI ORDERS, ALP DOES:

1) In readme.md, add straightforward instructions to use the package. Like you import the package and just call a func and show the print output. Check this repo https://github.com/carpedm20/emoji

3) Add docstring for the methods and classes.
You can see some examples here:

WHEN PULL REQUESTING:
- Tell Ali that you made the paths of LocationProject/trial_data.ipynb private but not the extracting_graphs.ipynb since they are relative paths.
